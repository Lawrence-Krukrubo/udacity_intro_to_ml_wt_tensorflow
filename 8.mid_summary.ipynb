    "## Recap\n",
    "In this lesson, you were introduced to linear models. Specifically, you saw:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Gradient descent`** as a method to optimize your linear models.\n",
    "* **`Multiple Linear Regression`** as a technique for when you are comparing more than two variables.\n",
    "* **`Polynomial Regression`** for relationships between variables that aren't linear.\n",
    "* **`Regularization`** as a technique to assure that your models will not only fit to the data available, but also extend to new situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outro\n",
    "In the prevous notebooks, you were predicting quantitative values. Predicting quantitative values is often just considered a **Regression** problem. In the next lesson, you will be introduced to predicting a category, which is called a **Classification** problem."
