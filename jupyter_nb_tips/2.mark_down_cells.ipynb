    "As mentioned before, cells can also be used for text written in Markdown. Markdown is a formatting syntax that allows you to include links, style text as bold or italicized, and format code. As with code cells, you press **Shift + Enter** or **Control + Enter** to run the Markdown cell, where it will render the Markdown to formatted text. Including text allows you to write a narrative alongside your code, as well as documenting your code and the thoughts that went into it.\n",
